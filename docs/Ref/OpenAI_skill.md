# Agent Skills

Use agent skills to extend Codex with task-specific capabilities. A skill packages instructions, resources, and optional scripts so Codex can follow a workflow reliably. You can share skills across teams or with the community. Skills build on the [open agent skills standard](https://agentskills.io).

Skills are available in both the Codex CLI and IDE extensions.

## Agent skill definition

A skill captures a capability expressed through Markdown instructions in a `SKILL.md` file. A skill folder can also include scripts, resources, and assets that Codex uses to perform a specific task.

<FileTree
  class="mt-4"
  tree={[
    {
      name: "my-skill/",
      open: true,
      children: [
        {
          name: "SKILL.md",
          comment: "Required: instructions + metadata",
        },
        {
          name: "scripts/",
          comment: "Optional: executable code",
        },
        {
          name: "references/",
          comment: "Optional: documentation",
        },
        {
          name: "assets/",
          comment: "Optional: templates, resources",
        },
      ],
    },
  ]}
/>

Skills use **progressive disclosure** to manage context efficiently. At startup, Codex loads the name and description of each available skill. Codex can then activate and use a skill in two ways:

1. **Explicit invocation:** You include skills directly in your prompt. To select one, run the `/skills` slash command, or start typing `$` to mention a skill. Codex web and iOS don't support explicit invocation yet, but you can still ask Codex to use any skill checked into a repo.

    />
  </div>
</div>

2. **Implicit invocation:** Codex can decide to use an available skill when your task matches the skill's description.

In either method, Codex reads the full instructions of the invoked skills and any extra references checked into the skill.

## Where to save skills

[Team Config](https://developers.openai.com/codex/enterprise/admin-setup#team-config) defines where Codex loads skills. If multiple skills share the same `name`, Codex does not deduplicate them, and both can appear in skill selectors.

| Skill Scope | Location                                                                                                                                           | Suggested use                                                                                                                                                                                        |

For example, skills only relevant to a microservice or a module.                              |
| `REPO`      | `$CWD/../.codex/skills` <br /> A folder above CWD when you launch Codex inside a Git repository.                                                   | If you're in a repository with nested folders, organizations can check in skills relevant to a shared area in a parent folder.                                                                       |

Available to everyone when they start Codex.                                                                   |

Codex supports symlinked skill folders and follows the symlink target when scanning these locations.

## Enable or disable skills

Per-skill enablement in `~/.codex/config.toml` is experimental and may change as needed. Use `[[skills.config]]` entries to disable a skill without deleting it, then restart Codex:

```toml
[[skills.config]]
path = "/path/to/skill"
enabled = false
```

## Create a skill

To create a new skill, use the built-in `$skill-creator` skill in Codex. Describe what you want your skill to do, and Codex will start bootstrapping your skill.

If you also install `$create-plan` (experimental) with `$skill-installer install the create-plan skill from the .experimental folder`, Codex will create a plan for your skill before it writes files.

For a step-by-step guide, see [Create custom skills](https://developers.openai.com/codex/skills/create-skill).

You can also create a skill manually by creating a folder with a `SKILL.md` file inside a valid skill location. A `SKILL.md` must contain a `name` and `description` to help Codex select the skill:

```md
---
name: skill-name
description: Description that helps Codex select the skill
metadata:
  short-description: Optional user-facing description
---

Skill instructions for the Codex agent to follow when using this skill.
```

Codex skills build on the [agent skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification). Check out the documentation to learn more.

## Install new skills

To install more than the built-in skills, you can download skills from a [curated set of skills on GitHub](https://github.com/openai/skills) using the `$skill-installer` skill:

```bash
$skill-installer install the linear skill from the .experimental folder
```

You can also prompt the installer to download skills from other repositories.

After installing a skill, restart Codex to pick up new skills.

## Skill examples

### Plan a new feature

`$create-plan` is an experimental skill that you can install with `$skill-installer` to have Codex research and create a plan to build a new feature or solve a complex problem:

```bash
$skill-installer install the create-plan skill from the .experimental folder
```

### Access Linear context for Codex tasks

```bash
$skill-installer install the linear skill from the .experimental folder
```

### Have Codex access Notion for more context

```bash
$skill-installer notion-spec-to-implementation
```
