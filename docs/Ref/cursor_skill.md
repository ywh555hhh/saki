Agent Skills
Agent Skills is an open standard for extending AI agents with specialized capabilities. Skills package domain-specific knowledge and workflows that agents can use to perform specific tasks.

What are skills?
A skill is a portable, version-controlled package that teaches agents how to perform domain-specific tasks. Skills can include both instructions and executable scripts or code that agents can run.

Portable

Skills work across any agent that supports the Agent Skills standard.

Version-controlled

Skills are stored as files and can be tracked in your repository, or installed via GitHub repository links.

Executable

Skills can include scripts and code that agents execute to perform tasks.

Progressive

Skills load resources on demand, keeping context usage efficient.

How skills work
When Cursor starts, it automatically discovers skills from skill directories and makes them available to Agent. The agent is presented with available skills and decides when they are relevant based on context.

Skills can also be manually invoked by typing / in Agent chat and searching for the skill name.

Skill directories
Skills are automatically loaded from these locations:

Location	Scope
.cursor/skills/	Project-level
.claude/skills/	Project-level (Claude compatibility)
.codex/skills/	Project-level (Codex compatibility)
~/.cursor/skills/	User-level (global)
~/.claude/skills/	User-level (global, Claude compatibility)
~/.codex/skills/	User-level (global, Codex compatibility)
Each skill should be a folder containing a SKILL.md file:


.cursor/
└── skills/
    └── my-skill/
        └── SKILL.md
Skills can also include optional directories for scripts, references, and assets:


.cursor/
└── skills/
    └── deploy-app/
        ├── SKILL.md
        ├── scripts/
        │   ├── deploy.sh
        │   └── validate.py
        ├── references/
        │   └── REFERENCE.md
        └── assets/
            └── config-template.json
SKILL.md file format
Each skill is defined in a SKILL.md file with YAML frontmatter:


---
name: my-skill
description: Short description of what this skill does and when to use it.
---
# My Skill
Detailed instructions for the agent.
## When to Use
- Use this skill when...
- This skill is helpful for...
## Instructions
- Step-by-step guidance for the agent
- Domain-specific conventions
- Best practices and patterns
- Use the ask questions tool if you need to clarify requirements with the user
Frontmatter fields
Field	Required	Description
name	Yes	Skill identifier. Lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only. Must match the parent folder name.
description	Yes	Describes what the skill does and when to use it. Used by the agent to determine relevance.
license	No	License name or reference to a bundled license file.
compatibility	No	Environment requirements (system packages, network access, etc.).
metadata	No	Arbitrary key-value mapping for additional metadata.
disable-model-invocation	No	When true, the skill is only included when explicitly invoked via /skill-name. The agent will not automatically apply it based on context.
Disabling automatic invocation
By default, skills are automatically applied when the agent determines they are relevant. Set disable-model-invocation: true to make a skill behave like a traditional slash command, where it is only included in context when you explicitly type /skill-name in chat.

Including scripts in skills
Skills can include a scripts/ directory containing executable code that agents can run. Reference scripts in your SKILL.md using relative paths from the skill root.


---
name: deploy-app
description: Deploy the application to staging or production environments. Use when deploying code or when the user mentions deployment, releases, or environments.
---
# Deploy App
Deploy the application using the provided scripts.
## Usage
Run the deployment script: `scripts/deploy.sh <environment>`
Where `<environment>` is either `staging` or `production`.
## Pre-deployment Validation
Before deploying, run the validation script: `python scripts/validate.py`
The agent reads these instructions and executes the referenced scripts when the skill is invoked. Scripts can be written in any language—Bash, Python, JavaScript, or any other executable format supported by the agent implementation.

Scripts should be self-contained, include helpful error messages, and handle edge cases gracefully.

Optional directories
Skills support these optional directories:

Directory	Purpose
scripts/	Executable code that agents can run
references/	Additional documentation loaded on demand
assets/	Static resources like templates, images, or data files
Keep your main SKILL.md focused and move detailed reference material to separate files. This keeps context usage efficient since agents load resources progressively—only when needed.

Viewing skills
To view discovered skills:

Open Cursor Settings (Cmd+Shift+J on Mac, Ctrl+Shift+J on Windows/Linux)
Navigate to Rules
Skills appear in the Agent Decides section
Installing skills from GitHub
You can import skills from GitHub repositories:

Open Cursor Settings → Rules
In the Project Rules section, click Add Rule
Select Remote Rule (Github)
Enter the GitHub repository URL
Migrating rules and commands to skills
Cursor includes a built-in /migrate-to-skills skill in 2.4 that helps you convert existing dynamic rules and slash commands to skills.

The migration skill converts:

Dynamic rules: Rules that use the "Apply Intelligently" configuration—rules with alwaysApply: false (or undefined) and no globs patterns defined. These are converted to standard skills.
Slash commands: Both user-level and workspace-level commands are converted to skills with disable-model-invocation: true, preserving their explicit invocation behavior.
To migrate:

Type /migrate-to-skills in Agent chat
The agent will identify eligible rules and commands and convert them to skills
Review the generated skills in .cursor/skills/
Rules with alwaysApply: true or specific globs patterns are not migrated, as they have explicit triggering conditions that differ from skill behavior. User rules are also not migrated since they are not stored on the file system.
