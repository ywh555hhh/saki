Cascade
Skills
Skills help Cascade handle complex, multi-step tasks.

The hardest engineering tasks often take more than just good prompts. They might require reference scripts, templates, checklists, and other supporting files. Skills let you bundle all of these together into folders that Cascade can invoke (read and use).
Skills are a great way to teach Cascade how to execute multi-step workflows consistently.
Cascade uses progressive disclosure to intelligently invoke skills only when they’re relevant to the task at hand. You can also manually invoke skills.

​
How to Create a Skill
​
Using the UI (easiest)
Open the Cascade panel
Click the three dots in the top right of the panel to open up the customizations menu
Click on the Skills section
Click + Workspace to create a workspace (project-specific) skill, or + Global to create a global skill
Name the skill (lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only)
​
Manual Creation
Workspace Skill (project-specific):
Create a directory: .windsurf/skills/<skill-name>/
Add a SKILL.md file with YAML frontmatter
Global Skill (available in all workspaces):
Create a directory: ~/.codeium/windsurf/skills/<skill-name>/
Add a SKILL.md file with YAML frontmatter
​
SKILL.md File Format
Each skill requires a SKILL.md file with YAML frontmatter containing the skill’s metadata:
​
Example skill
---
name: deploy-to-production
description: Guides the deployment process to production with safety checks
---

## Pre-deployment Checklist
1. Run all tests
2. Check for uncommitted changes
3. Verify environment variables

## Deployment Steps
Follow these steps to deploy safely...

[Reference supporting files in this directory as needed]
​
Required Frontmatter Fields
name: Unique identifier for the skill (displayed in UI and used for @-mentions)
description: Brief explanation shown to the model to help it decide when to invoke the skill
Examples of valid names: deploy-to-staging, code-review, setup-dev-environment
​
Adding Supporting Resources
Place any supporting files in the skill folder alongside SKILL.md. These files become available to Cascade when the skill is invoked:
.windsurf/skills/deploy-to-production/
├── SKILL.md
├── deployment-checklist.md
├── rollback-procedure.md
└── config-template.yaml
​
Invoking Skills
​
Automatic Invocation
When your request matches a skill’s description, Cascade automatically invokes the skill and uses its instructions and resources to complete the task. This is the most common way skills are used—you simply describe what you want to do, and Cascade determines which skills are relevant.
The description field in your skill’s frontmatter is key: it helps Cascade understand when to invoke the skill. Write descriptions that clearly explain what the skill does and when it should be used.
​
Manual Invocation
You can always explicitly activate a skill by typing @skill-name in the Cascade input. This is useful when you want to ensure a specific skill is used, or when you want to invoke a skill that might not be automatically triggered by your request.
​
Skill Scopes
Scope	Location	Availability
Workspace	.windsurf/skills/	Current workspace/project only
Global	~/.codeium/windsurf/skills/	All workspaces/projects
​
Example Use Cases
​
Deployment Workflow
Create a skill with deployment scripts, environment configs, and rollback procedures:
.windsurf/skills/deploy-staging/
├── SKILL.md
├── pre-deploy-checks.sh
├── environment-template.env
└── rollback-steps.md
​
Code Review Guidelines
Include style guides, security checklists, and review templates:
.windsurf/skills/code-review/
├── SKILL.md
├── style-guide.md
├── security-checklist.md
└── review-template.md
​
Testing Procedures
Bundle test templates, coverage requirements, and CI/CD configs:
.windsurf/skills/run-tests/
├── SKILL.md
├── test-template.py
├── coverage-config.json
└── ci-workflow.yaml
​
Best Practices
Write clear descriptions: The description helps Cascade decide when to invoke the skill. Be specific about what the skill does and when it should be used.
Include relevant resources: Templates, checklists, and examples make skills more useful. Think about what files would help someone complete the task.
Use descriptive names: deploy-to-staging is better than deploy1. Names should clearly indicate what the skill does.
​
Skills vs Rules
Skills and Rules are both ways to customize Cascade’s behavior, but they serve different purposes:
Feature	Skills	Rules
Purpose	Complex tasks with supporting resources	Behavioral guidelines and preferences
Structure	Folder with SKILL.md + resource files	Single .md file
Invocation	Automatic (progressive disclosure) or @-mention	Trigger-based (always-on, glob patterns, or manual)
Best for	Multi-step workflows, deployment procedures, code review processes	Coding style preferences, project conventions, response formatting
Use Skills when you need Cascade to follow a specific procedure with supporting files. Use Rules when you want to influence how Cascade behaves across conversations.
